It can improve your mood, lower stress levels, increase productivity, spark creativity, and studies have shown it can even boost your brain power by improving memory. However, classical music has a diversity problem. It is far too white and far too inaccessible to a lot of people. More needs to be done to take classical music out of the traditional concert hall and brought to a much wider range of communities, to make it more accessible to all, and to break down the barriers and stereotypes surrounding the genre.\n\nThrough combining demographic data collected by Greater London Authority in 2016, and Foursquare location data, this project aims to highlight potential areas and venues in London that could host a \u2018New-style\u2019 Classical Music Festival. It should appeal to any philanthropist wanting to increase the outreach of classical music.\n"
